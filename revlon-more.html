  <h1>PACKAGE REDESIGN</h1>
  <p>Package redesign of a Revlon makeup brush. The aim was to create a package that would use less non-recyclable materials. I also had to keep in mind that the package had to be entirely enclosed, to keep it sanitary.

I created a box with a clear ‘window’ made of a small amount of plastic at the top so people could still see what the brush looks like. That solved the problem of having too much plastic.

I kept the same colours and design because it is was more about the packaging rather than a rebrand.
