  <h1>CHEESE HAUS</h1>
  <p>Complete rebrand for a small business out of Mildmay, Ontario. This project is one of the bigger ones that I have done, involving many hours of sketches, consultation, and far too long in Illustrator.</p>
  <p>Lots of the companies in smaller towns are starting to update their brands and logos in order to keep up with the times, this is an example of that. I wanted to give them something modern, but not to diffuse their family-friendly, hometown feel.</p>
  <p>I kept the mouse in their logo, and I updated the oranges to be more bright and welcoming. I changed them over from a serif to a sans serif font, which on itâ€™s own really modernized their brand. I ended up with something very simple and modern, but that mouse adds some interest and fun into the brand.</p>
