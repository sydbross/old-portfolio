  <h1 class="gutter">BANFF STICKER</h1>
  <p class="push gutter">After spending the summer out west, a good friend of mine decided that since we both like art, that we should design each other stickers as a parting gift rather than spending money on anything. This one is definitely more of a personal preference type of project, but I chose to do our group of friends, sitting in a park watching the smoky sunset. I have very fond memories of that time and knew just how to capture it.</p>
