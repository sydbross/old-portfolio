  <h1>CHEO BOOKLET</h1>
  <p>Bilingual annual report for CHEO. The only people who would really read this booklet are investors and stockholders, but I wanted to give it some edge. It is a children's hospital after all, and adding a sort of playfulness was the idea I had in mind.</p>
  <p>For the layout, the picture I had in my mind involved many big photos, as well as a very simple layout for the paragraphs so I could play with white space. There was also a lot of content that I had to fit in, so I had to keep that in mind within my sketches as well. Keeping in mind that this book is bilingual, I chose to have all the english content in the first half of the book, then the reader can flip the book over, revealing the french version. That way there is no confusion, and it doesn’t end up being too cluttered. I find that it is easier to read something all the way through, than skip parts that you don’t have to read, i.e. french if you are english.</p>
  <p>I used a sans-serif font, for the main text (titles, subtitles, page numbers). I chose the font I did because the rounded caps give the font such a delicate feeling. I had the idea of colours being brought in, but at first, I really had to think about the type of palette I was going for. I didn’t want the colours to be too bright. I finally decided on soothing and subdued tones of red, aqua, beige, and navy.</p>
